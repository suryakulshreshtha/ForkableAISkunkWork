"""Automatic failure analysis.

Classification is rule-first: a regex table maps the error text to a category
with a default cause and fix. The knowledge base then supplies project-specific
remediation, and a local model - if one is loaded - writes the human summary
grounded in those retrieved passages. Without a model the diagnosis is still
useful, just terser.
